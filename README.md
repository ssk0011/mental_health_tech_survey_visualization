# mental_health_tech_survey_visualization
Out of interest in exploring available Python packages for interactive dashboards, I decided to test the Panel Python package for EDA on a real data Kaggle 2014 mental health work survey. Sample of the localhost can be seen in the screenshot below:

Please make sure to install the following packages in your local environment:

```
pip install panel pandas hvplot bokeh numpy jupyterlab

```

To run the dashboard, clone the repository and run the following command from your terminal:

```
panel tech_mental_health_survey_visualization.ipynb
```
